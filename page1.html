	<P> 
In 18th-century Naples, pizza existed as a simple flatbread base, popular among the poor and sold cheaply by street vendors. In 1889, Queen Margherita of Savoy tried pizza and enjoyed it, prompting Chef Raffaele Esposito to create a special version for her. He topped the base with mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil, symbolizing the Italian flag's red, white, and green colors. This creation became both the queen's favorite pizza and the origin of the now-famous Margherita pizza. </p>
