        <p>The Colosseum of Rome is one of the most visited tourist sites in Italy. This oval amphitheater in the center of Rome bears witness to numerous significant historical events. The construction of the Colosseum began in AD 72 during the rule of Emperor Vespasian, and his successor, Titus, completed the structure in AD 80. The Colosseum at the time of its construction had a capacity of about 50,000 to 80,000. For years, it served as the venue of mock sea battles and gladitorial contests. Later on, animal hunts, Classical mythology based dramas, executions, and re-enactments of major battles were also hosted at the site.  </p>

	<p>The Leaning Tower of Pisa, famous for its unintended tilt, is located in the Italian city of Pisa. It is the freestanding bell tower of the city’s cathedral. The tower is the third oldest structure of the Cathedral Square of Pisa. The tilt of the tower resulted from an error in construction but became famous over the years or its unique property. The tilt was actually caused due to an inadequate foundation on a soft ground not sufficient to bear the tower’s weight. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is 183.27 feet high on the lower side and 185.93 feet high at the higher end.</p>

        <p>A medieval cathedral in Siena, the Siena Cathedral is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary. The design and construction of the cathedral were initiated in 1215 and completed in 1263. The cathedral is in the form of a Latin cross with a bell tower, a slightly projecting transept and dome. The dome of the structure rises from a hexagonal base and a lantern on top of the dome was added by Bernini. White, greenish-black, and red marble are used in the exteriors and interiors of the Siena Cathedral. The greenish-black and white marbles are designed in alternating stripes and represent the symbolic colors of Siena.  </p>
